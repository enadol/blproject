# blproject
Scripts in Python to process data for diverse projects in enadol.de, with @openfootball and @fbjsonrobot data as a starting point. 

* Converts JSON files in different templates (mostly .js for specific projects).
* Processes data of the Bundesliga season, from JSONs
* Creates a Javascript file template
* Outputs an Excel file with the complete MD positions
* Creates and updates a database in .sqlite format with all key data for each matchday
* .sqlite data opens the possibility of making complete, local, visitor queries and tables

## NEW (26.08.2019) Process launches now coming from fbjsonrobot. No second launch.py is needed, just needs second MD confirmation in prompt and that's it!
